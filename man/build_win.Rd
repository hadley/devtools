\description{
This function works by bundling source package, and then uploading to
\url{http://win-builder.r-project.org/}.  Once building is complete you'll
receive a link to the built package in the email address listed in the
maintainer field.  It usually takes around 30 minutes. As a side effect,
win-build also runs \code{R CMD check} on the package, so \code{build_win}
is also useful to check that your package is ok on windows.
